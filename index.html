				<div class="about_details">
					<p>I am a <mark>data analyst</mark>, a lifelong student of <mark>Philosophy</mark> and <mark>Logic</mark>, an appreciator of the <mark>Arts</mark>, <mark>Literature</mark>, and <mark>Culture</mark> &mdash; a researcher. Some times I may also be found behind books of <mark>Psychology</mark> and <mark>Sociology</mark>.</p>
					<p>As a <mark>data analyst</mark>, I have a passion for creating 360&deg; views of data, harnessing newfound powers of computers to help make data analyses efficient and timely. Of particular interest to me are automating analyses, obtaining data from unconventional sources (Web, Social Media, etc.), generating effective visualisations, and reproducible research.</p>
					<p>My analytics repertoire includes:
					<ul class="analytics_repertoire">
						<li>SQL (Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, PL/SQL, T-SQL)</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.toadworld.com" target="_blank">Toad</a></li>
						<li>Excel</li>
						<li><a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/products/modeler/" target="_blank">IBM SPSS Modeler</a></li>

						<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/" target="_blank">XPath</a></li>
					</ul>						
					</p>
					<p>In <mark>Philosophy</mark>, I am interested in Philosophy of Language, Moral Philosophy, Philosophy of Religion, Philosophy of Art, Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of AI, and Philosophy of Statistics. I am currently in the process of reading <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/" target="_blank">Plato</a> and <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/" target="_blank">Wittgenstein</a>. In regards to <mark>Literature</mark> and <mark>Culture</mark>, I find the revealed scriptures, especially those of the Abrahamic faiths, to be awe-inspiring for raising important questions. I was born in Pakistan, but lived most of my life in the Middle East. I had to, then, travel to Europe for higher education. Noticing the cultural differences in the three regions has sparked in me a great interest for Anthropology.</p>
					<p>In my free time, I am either working on analytics' projects, studying online courses, reading books, or spending time with family.</p>

						<u>An Investigation of the use of Artificial Neural Networks in the automatic detection of cyber-attacks using temporal network log traces</u>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-5">
						<p>I worked on this project for my BSc dissertation: Modern organisations depend on the use of Networks (WLANs and LANs) to conduct and support communication over large geographical distances, and to access the wealth of information sealed in the World Wide Web. However, such organisations are also constantly plagued by Network attacks, and these must be dealt with to ensure smooth communication and to benefit from the WWW.</p> 
						<p>The continual emergence of novel attacks puts the conventional remedies, such as firewalls and intrusion detection tools, at a disadvantage, as there would exist no rule of thumb to successfully pre-determine novel attacks. To such problems, where decisions ought to be made from minimum information, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can be applied. The application of ANNs to such tasks was investigated in this project.</p>
